I created this website "Slate" by using HTML and CSS. This website has many different HTML elements, in addition to CSS elements.

It is also fully responsive on laptop, tablet, and mobile!

This is one of the first few projects I built as I learned code. It will be part of a way to see my progress as I gain more skills as a software engineer
